Given some definition:

* [**RFCs** (Request for comments)](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments)
  are used in software engineering to discribe and agreed on
  expected behaviors of an application
* **furret-ui** expected to be a *yet another* standalone web client
  javascript framework that aims to be highly dynamic and modular.
  called **the or this framework** in this book.

The first use case of this *framework* will be in [erpblok](
https://github.com/erpblok/erpblok) which is based on Anyblok, but again
this *framework* will be availlaible as standalone tool.


## Intent

The goal of this book/repo is to design and specify the *framwork*. We
may speak about severals topic:

* default styles (css)
* behaviors of any component
* Interfaces between a web client and a server (if a developer wants
  to use this *framework* without Anyblok nor Erpblok).
* Difine the API
* give some code snipet to show how developers should use the 
  *framework*
* ...

So intent users are developers that wants to extend, understand
or create a service that implement interfaces to communicates with
this *framework*


## Meta RFC

Each RFC must respect [gitbook format](http://toolchain.gitbook.com/)

At the moment the process is not define, feel free to create a Pull
Request.
