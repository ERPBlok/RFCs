# RFCs

This is the furret-ui framework RFCs. 

* [**RFCs** (Request for comments)](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments)
  are used in software engineering to discribe and agreed on
  expected behaviors of an application
* **furret-ui** expected to be a *yet another* standalone web client
  framework that aims to be highly dynamic and modular.

The first use case of **furret-ui** will be in [erpblok](
https://github.com/erpblok/erpblok) whih is based on Anyblok, but again
**furret-ui** will be availlaible as standalone framework.
